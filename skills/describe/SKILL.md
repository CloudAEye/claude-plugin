name: describe
description: Describe the uncommitted changes in this repo — a Change Description heading and an Important Changes bullet list, in plain markdown ready to paste into a PR or a commit message. Trivial diffs short-circuit to one line.
when_to_use: Use when the user asks what changed, for a PR description, a commit message, or a summary of the pending diff.

## Steps

1. Prepare and upload the review session.

   First collect the local repository identity with one Bash call.

   ```bash
   cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
   for c in python python3 py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c "" 2>/dev/null && { PY=$c; break; }; done
   [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "cloudaeye_error=python_not_found"; exit 1; }
   mkdir -p .cloudaeye/session && printf '*\n' > .cloudaeye/.gitignore
   REPO=$(basename -s .git "$(git config --get remote.origin.url)"); [ -n "$REPO" ] || REPO=$(basename "$PWD")
   BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD); HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   "$PY" -c "import json,sys;print(json.dumps(dict(repo=sys.argv[1],branch=sys.argv[2],head=sys.argv[3])))" "$REPO" "$BRANCH" "$HEAD_SHA"
   ```

   Call `mcp__plugin_cloudaeye_cloudaeye__start_session` with those three values — no `language`; the server derives the tech-stack hint from the uploaded diff, which describes the change rather than the repo around it. If the tool is unavailable or returns `status: error`, stop and tell the user to authenticate CloudAEye through `/mcp`.

   Validate the returned values before substituting them below: `session_id` must contain only hex digits and dashes, `upload_token` exactly 64 hex characters, `upload_url` must be HTTPS or localhost HTTP, and `target_branch` must match `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+` without starting with `-`; use an empty target when it does not. Then run this as one Bash call. The upload token is written only to a private temporary curl config and is never printed or stored in the repository.

   ```bash
   CE_SESSION='<session_id>'
   CE_UPLOAD_URL='<upload_url>'
   CE_UPLOAD_TOKEN='<upload_token>'
   TARGET='<validated target_branch or empty>'
   cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
   case "$CE_SESSION" in ''|*[!0-9A-Fa-f-]*) echo "cloudaeye_error=bad_session"; exit 1;; esac
   case "$CE_UPLOAD_TOKEN" in *[!0-9A-Fa-f]*|'') echo "cloudaeye_error=bad_upload_token"; exit 1;; esac
   [ "${#CE_UPLOAD_TOKEN}" = 64 ] || { echo "cloudaeye_error=bad_upload_token"; exit 1; }
   case "$CE_UPLOAD_URL" in https://*|http://localhost/*|http://localhost:*|http://127.0.0.1/*|http://127.0.0.1:*) ;; *) echo "cloudaeye_error=insecure_url"; exit 1;; esac
   CE_TMP=$(mktemp -d 2>/dev/null) || CE_TMP="${TMPDIR:-${TMP:-/tmp}}/cloudaeye-$$"
   mkdir -p "$CE_TMP" || { echo "cloudaeye_error=bad_config"; exit 1; }
   trap 'rm -rf "$CE_TMP"' EXIT INT TERM
   printf 'header = "X-Upload-Token: %s"\n' "$CE_UPLOAD_TOKEN" > "$CE_TMP/curl.cfg"
   chmod 600 "$CE_TMP/curl.cfg" 2>/dev/null || true
   case "$TARGET" in ''|-*|*[!A-Za-z0-9._/-]*) TARGET="";; esac
   HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD); BASE=""; SRC=fork_point
   if [ -n "$TARGET" ]; then
     git rev-parse --verify -q "origin/$TARGET" >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
       GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 GCM_INTERACTIVE=never GIT_ASKPASS=echo \
       git -c credential.helper= fetch -q origin "$TARGET" 2>/dev/null
     BASE=$(git merge-base "origin/$TARGET" HEAD 2>/dev/null)
   fi
   [ -n "$BASE" ] || { BASE=$HEAD_SHA; SRC=head; }
   git add --intent-to-add . >/dev/null 2>&1
   git diff "$BASE" > .cloudaeye/session/session.diff
   UP=$(curl -s -m 120 -K "$CE_TMP/curl.cfg" -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' \
     -F "file=@.cloudaeye/session/session.diff" -F "base_sha=$BASE" "$CE_UPLOAD_URL")
   echo "session_id=$CE_SESSION base_source=$SRC base_age=$(git log -1 --format=%cr "origin/$TARGET" 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)"
   echo "diff_bytes=$(wc -c < .cloudaeye/session/session.diff) diff_files=$(git diff --name-only "$BASE" | wc -l) upload_http=$UP"
   ```

   Read the two summary lines and the `start_session` result; don't re-derive them:

   | output | what to do with it |
   |---|---|
   | `start_session` unavailable or `status: error` | Stop and tell the user to authenticate CloudAEye through `/mcp`. |
   | `cloudaeye_error=…` | Stop and report it. Never print `upload_token`. |
   | `session_id=…` | Pass it to the MCP tool. |
   | `diff_bytes=0` | Nothing pending — report "nothing to describe" and stop. |
   | `base_source=fork_point` | Correct baseline: the fork point off the integrated branch, not its tip. Name the branch and `base_age`; a very old baseline may miss newer merged work. |
   | `base_source=head` | Degraded: only working-tree edits are in the diff. Say so. If `start_session` returned `setup_required`, report its `reason` and `remedy` verbatim — that is the actionable form. Do **not** quote `target_branch_error`: it names an internal record ("no datastore credentials for tenant 99") and tells the user nothing they can act on. |
   | `upload_http=` not `200` | The diff never reached the server. Stop; otherwise a stale result can look clean. |

   **Which baseline applied must reach the user.** Every degradation still produces output that looks correct, so silence about it is the one failure mode that misleads. Keeping the clone current is the developer's job — the skill never forces a fetch, it just refuses to hide what it used.
2. Call CloudAEye's `describe_change` MCP tool with:
   - `session_id`: the `session_id` printed by step 1
   - `intent`: the user's original task request from this coding session, passed verbatim. Do not paraphrase. If `/cloudaeye:review` already set an intent this turn, pass the same string. Write it from your own working context; do not read `.cloudaeye/session/session.diff` or run `git diff` to compose it — the server already has the diff.
   - `context`: omit unless you have something extra to pass (e.g. `pr_title`). Identity fields are already on the session.
3. Print the `description` field from the response verbatim. It is plain markdown — a `# Change Description` paragraph followed by an `## Important Changes` bullet list — meant for direct consumption (no XML wrappers, no `<details>`). For trivial diffs the description is a single-sentence "Trivial change —" line; do not pad it.

   Call `mcp__plugin_cloudaeye_cloudaeye__describe_change`; it is pre-approved in this skill's frontmatter.

   Check `context_refresh.status` first. On `skipped` or `failed` the stored code graph was not refreshed with this diff, so the answer is based on the pre-edit code plus the diff text alone — say so in one line and quote `context_refresh.reason`. It is usually an expired GitHub installation token, which the user has to fix server-side.

## Notes

- This is a **single-shot** skill — one call, print the output, done. No loop, no fix-and-retry.
- Good moments to invoke: before opening a PR, before writing a commit message, when the user asks "what did I just change?"
- Pre-commit only: the diff is always `git diff` (working tree vs `HEAD`). Committing moves `HEAD`; the review session persists.
- Without a `client_git_token` / `client_git_owner` configured on the server, the code-context refresh is skipped and the description falls back to diff-only analysis (still works, just less precise on blast radius).
- If `describe_change` is unavailable (MCP not connected), warn the user and skip — do not attempt to describe the diff yourself from `git diff` output.
- The full investigation trace is logged on the server under `query_logs/` keyed by `run_id` (included in the response's `eval_summary`).
